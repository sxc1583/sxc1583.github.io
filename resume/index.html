  <h2 class="sub-title"> Biography </h2>

  <p> Born in <em> Seoul, South Korea </em> and raised in <em> Lubbock, Texas </em>, <strong> Soohyun Chae </strong> began his violin training at the age of 6 under the tutelage of Kirsten Yon. During his early years as a violinist, he joined STELR
    (Suzuki Talent Education of the Lubbock Region) as well as the Lubbock Youth Symphony Orchestra, serving frequent leadership positions over his many years of participation. He was also involved in multiple school ensembles, participating in
    numerous UIL and TMEA-hosted events. Alongside his studies on the violin, Soohyun also pursued piano, studying under William Westney and participating in competitions such as Juanita-Miller, Baylor, and the TMTA competition. Eventually, after
    realizing his passion for chamber musci and the violin in high school, Soohyun took on a more streamlined music study, dropping piano as a hobby and studying violin more seriously under Professor John Gilbert of Texas Tech University. <br>
    <br>
    Soohyun has received lessons and masterclasses from numerous distinguished professors, including Sally O’Reilly, Yair Kless, Cornelia Heard, Wen Zhou Li, Joseph Kalichstein, and Peter Otto. On top of his musical experiences, he has won numerous
    Texas state-wide honors. He has been a member of Texas All-State Orchestra for 3 years as well as being selected as an Outstanding Performer at the Texas State Solo and Ensemble Violin Solo Contest 3 times in a row. Soohyun also won the LYSO
    Concerto Competition in 2016, performing the Barber Violin Concerto with orchestra during LYSO’s Spring Concert. Recently, through his participation with the Henry Mancini Institute Orchestra, he has collaborated with film composer Jeff Beal as
    well as performers Jon Secada, Ann Callaway, and Kirk Whalum. <br>
    <br>
    Currently, Soohyun studies with Charles Castleman as a Distinguished Stamps Scholar at the Frost School of Music. With his time in the <strong> Stamps String Quartet Class of 2022 </strong>, he hopes to further develop his chamber music
    experiences as well as become a well-versed musician.
