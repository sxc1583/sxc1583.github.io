        <div class="quartet-bio_text">
          <p>Hailing from all around the country, the Stamps String Quartet consists of 4 gifted undergraduate string musicians of the same graduating class studying Music Instrumental Performance at the Frost School of Music. As part of the prestigious and highly selective Stamps Scholar music program, they will stay together as a string quartet during their fully-funded undergraduate studies in order to pursue higher levels of chamber music playing. During this time, they will be provided close mentorship by Frost faculty and distinguished guest artists, various and unique opportunities for performance and outreach, and training for overall musicianship and career development.</p>
          <p>Since their first year of conception during the fall of 2018, the Stamps String Quartet have built up a strong foundation of experiences. They have worked with award-winning ensembles such as Sybarite5 and the Merel Quartet, receiving exclusive coachings and masterclasses from its members. They have also had the privilege of participating in the 50th Anniversary Season of the Castleman Quartet Program as a pre-formed group, working with renowned chamber coaches such as Csaba Erdélyi, George Taylor, Terry King, and Laura Bossert. The group has also been invited to perform in events such as Frost’s “Winter Wonderful” and the Adrienne Arsht Center’s “Jazz Roots” in tandem with the Henri Mancini Institute Orchestra, on top of other promotional events for the Frost School of Music. Outside of performing, they have been part of community outreach at the Lennar Foundation Medical Center and the Key Biscayne Community Center. They have also worked closely with Conduit and NWS Creative Director Siggi Bachmann in workshops focused on audience experience design for artist-entrepreneurs of the modern classical music scene.</p>
          <p>Currently, the Stamps String Quartet is overseen by artistic director and chamber coach, Jodi Levitz and coaches, Ross Harbaugh and Charles Castleman. In the upcoming years, the quartet hopes to travel the world together, apply for different quartet fellowships and competitions, and expand their knowledge and love for string quartet repertoire to share with their audience.</p>
